            New 1969-70 Ford Mustang Mach 1, Boss 302 and Boss 429 now on sale
            <br /><br />
            Ford has a new Mach 1 in the works.
            <br /><br />
            It’s not a Mustang, but an all-electric performance utility vehicle
            that it plans to unveil in a couple of years.

            <br /><br />
            If that’s not your thing, don’t worry, because now you can buy a
            brand new version of the original Mustang Mach 1.
            <br /><br />
            At least the closest thing to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Classic Recreations of Yukon, Oklahoma has been building a variety
            of officially-licensed continuation Mustang Shelby models for the
            past decade, and has now secured the rights to do the same for the
            1969-1970 Mach 1, Boss 302 and Boss 429.
            <br /><br />
            They start with either a new body built by R3 or a standard Mustang
            donor car that they strip down, get in perfect shape and add all of
            the bits needed to recreate the original look of the high
            performance models.
            <br /><br />
            Everything underneath gets a refresh, too, including a coilover
            suspension setup, modern brakes and a new Ford Performance engine.

          <b>Boss 429 (Classic Recreations)</b><br>
They’ll drop in pretty much anything the customer wants, but owner Jason Engel says the first 429 will have a 460 cubic-inch V8 with “Boss 9” hemispherical heads and electronic fuel injection that’s already putting out 700 hp, and they’re not done tuning it yet.

          <p>A Boss 302 and Mach 1 Are Also Available
            If you walk into a Ford dealer today, you can pick up a 2018 Mustang GT that makes 460 hp, hits 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, and includes an optional magnetic suspension for less than $45,000. It will be comfortable and refined enough to take on a road trip, while still keeping up with the pricier BMW M4 on the track.</p>

That's where continuation builders such as Classic Recreations come in.

            Classic Recreations has been building officially licensed Shelby Mustangs for a while, and according to our friends at AUTOMOBILE, they're good. Really good. Recently, CR landed the license to build three more classic Mustangs: the 1969-1970 Boss 302, the 1969-1970 Boss 429, and the 1969-1970 Mach 1. These aren't resto-mods, either. Underneath the vintage sheetmetal, you essentially get a brand new car.</p>
